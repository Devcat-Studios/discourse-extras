# Discourse Extras 2.1

Enhance your Discourse experience with **Discourse Extras**, a powerful userscript adding new features and improving existing ones. Version 2.1 introduces visibility of PMs you send, live preview support, and more!

- **Live Preview Support**  
  Discourse Extras integrates with the post editor’s live preview pane, showing your custom enhancements and markdown effects instantly while you type.

- **Improved Stability**  
  Minor bug fixes reduce error crashes for smoother, more reliable operation.
